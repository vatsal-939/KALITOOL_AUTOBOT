Output of mkpasswd -h:

Usage: mkpasswd [OPTIONS]... [PASSWORD [SALT]]
Crypts the PASSWORD using crypt(3).

      -m, --method=TYPE     select method TYPE
      -5                    like --method=md5crypt
      -S, --salt=SALT       use the specified SALT
      -R, --rounds=NUMBER   use the specified NUMBER of rounds
      -P, --password-fd=NUM read the password from file descriptor NUM
                            instead of /dev/tty
      -s, --stdin           like --password-fd=0
      -h, --help            display this help and exit
      -V, --version         output version information and exit

If PASSWORD is missing then it is asked interactively.
If no SALT is specified, a random one is generated.
If TYPE is 'help', available methods are printed.

Mkpasswd Services:

Global mkpasswd Notes (Apply to ALL Services)
⦁ Security Alerts
=> mkpasswd does NOT verify password strength
=> Output hashes are deterministic if PASSWORD + SALT are reused
=> Weak methods (e.g., MD5) are cryptographically broken

⦁ Automation Pitfalls
=> mkpasswd always exits with status 0, even for weak/insecure methods
=> Hash output is printed to stdout only — no file option
=> Newline characters from stdin become part of password if not trimmed

1. Password Hash Generation Service

Syntax:
mkpasswd [options] [PASSWORD [SALT]]

Options:
where ever see | means they cannot be combined.

⦁	Hashing Method Selection
-m <TYPE> | -5

-> mkpasswd --method=help (to see available methods)

⦁	Salt Handling
-S <SALT>

⦁	Rounds / Iteration Control
-R <NUMBER>

⦁	Password Input Source (Non-interactive)
-P | -s

⦁	Informational / Control Options
-h
-v

⦁ Hashing Method Warnings
-> -5:
            -> Forces MD5-crypt
            -> Considered insecure and deprecated
-> Modern systems prefer:
            -> sha256crypt
            -> sha512crypt
            -> yescrypt (if available)

⦁ Salt Handling Warnings
-> User-supplied -S:
            -> Must match method-specific format
            -> Invalid salt may be silently truncated
-> Random salts:
            -> Generated automatically if -S not supplied
            -> Safer default behavior

⦁ Rounds / Iteration Warnings
-> -R:
            -> Ignored by methods that don’t support rounds
            -> Excessively high values can cause CPU exhaustion

⦁ Password Input Source Pitfalls
-> -P / -s:
            -> Disable terminal echo protection
            -> Password may appear in:
                  -> Shell history
                  -> Process list (ps)
-> -s: Reads from stdin including whitespace and newline

2. Alternative Syntax & Informational Service

Syntax:
mkpasswd [options] [PASSWORD [SALT]]

Options:
where ever see | means they cannot be combined.

⦁	Long Form Flag Alternatives
--method=<TYPE> (equivalent to -m)
--salt=<SALT> (equivalent to -S)
--rounds=<NUMBER> (equivalent to -R)
--password-fd=<NUM> (equivalent to -P)
--stdin (equivalent to -s)
--help (equivalent to -h)
--version (equivalent to -V)

⦁	Version Information
-V | --version

-> Note: Service 1 lists -v, but help output shows -V (capital V) for version

⦁	Additional Notes
-> All flags have both short (-flag) and long (--flag) form alternatives
-> PASSWORD and SALT can be provided as positional arguments
-> If PASSWORD is missing, it is asked interactively (unless -P or -s is used)
-> If no SALT is specified, a random one is generated
-> Use mkpasswd --method=help to see all available hashing methods

=> Can be used alongside Service 1 options
=> Long forms are equivalent to short forms shown in Service 1\

⦁ Informational Mode Alerts
-> --method=help:
            -> Outputs methods supported by local system
            -> Available methods vary by:
                  -> OS
                  -> libc version
                  -> PAM configuration

⦁ Version & Help Behavior
-> --help / --version:
            -> Exit immediately
            -> Ignore all other arguments
-> -V:
            -> Correct flag for version (capital V)
            -> -v is invalid (good catch in your notes)

⦁ Positional Argument Pitfalls
-> Positional PASSWORD: Appears in shell history
-> Positional SALT: Overrides -S if both provided
