Output of zenmap -h:

Usage: zenmap [options] [result files]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --confdir=DIR         Use DIR as the user configuration directory. Default:
                        /root/.zenmap
  -f RESULT_FILES, --file=RESULT_FILES
                        Specify a scan result file in Nmap XML output format.
                        Can be used more than once to specify several scan
                        result files.
  -n, --nmap            Run Nmap with the specified args.
  -p PROFILE, --profile=PROFILE
                        Begin with the specified profile selected. If combined
                        with the -t (--target) option, automatically run the
                        profile against the specified target.
  -t TARGET, --target=TARGET
                        Specify a target to be used along with other options.
                        If specified alone, open with the target field filled
                        with the specified target
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity of the output. May be used more
                        than once to get even more verbosity

Zenmap Services:

GLOBAL ZENMAP NOTES (APPLY TO ALL SERVICES)
⦁	Zenmap is a GUI wrapper, not a scanner
=> Zenmap does not scan by itself
=> It delegates all scanning to nmap
=> Any scan failure is almost always:
        => Missing privileges
        => Invalid Nmap arguments
        => Nmap not installed / not in PATH

⦁	Automation limitation
=> Zenmap is not suitable for headless automation
=> Requires: X11 / GUI environment
=> For CLI automation: Use nmap directly
=> Zenmap is best used for:
        => Visualization
        => Profile management
        => Result comparison (manual)

1.	GUI Launch Service

Syntax:
zenmap

Options:

⦁	GUI / Environment Options
--confdir=<DIR>
-v
--version
-h

⦁	GUI Dependency
-> Requires:
        -> Active graphical session
        -> DISPLAY environment variable
-> Running over SSH requires: X11 forwarding
-> Otherwise: Zenmap will fail silently or exit

⦁	--confdir
-> Must be: Writable by user
-> Incorrect permissions cause:
        -> Profile load failures
        -> GUI state loss
-> Multiple Zenmap instances sharing same confdir may corrupt config

==========================================================================

2. Nmap Execution Service

Syntax:
zenmap -n "<nmap arguments>"

Options:

⦁	Zenmap-side Options
--confdir=<DIR>
-v

⦁	-n "<nmap arguments>" is opaque passthrough
-> Zenmap does not validate arguments
-> Invalid Nmap flags:
        -> Are passed directly
        -> Errors come from Nmap, not Zenmap

⦁	Quoting Requirement (CRITICAL)
-> Arguments must be passed as a single quoted string

⦁	Privilege Behavior
-> If scan requires root:
        -> Zenmap will prompt
        -> Or scan silently degrades
-> Behavior depends on:
        -> OS
        -> Polkit / sudo configuration

==========================================================================

3. Profile-based Scan Service

Syntax:
zenmap -p <profile> -t <target>

Options:

⦁	Zenmap-side Options
--confdir=<DIR>
-v

⦁	Profiles are local-state dependent
-> Profiles are stored in: --confdir
-> If profile name does not exist:
        -> Zenmap opens GUI but does not scan
        -> No explicit error is shown

⦁	-p without -t
-> Does not execute scan
-> Only selects profile in GUI

⦁ Profiles are NOT portable by default
-> Profile definitions:
        -> Are user-specific
        -> Are not bundled with Zenmap
-> Copying profiles requires: Manual export of config directory

==========================================================================

4. Result File Management Service

Syntax:
zenmap -f scan1.xml [-f scan2.xml...]

Options:

⦁	Zenmap-side Options
--confdir=<DIR>
-v

-> file type xml only.

⦁	XML FORMAT IS STRICT
-> Only Nmap XML output is accepted
-> Other formats (-oN, -oG, etc.) will:
        -> Fail to load
        -> Or silently not display results

⦁	Multiple -f Files
-> Zenmap loads them into comparison view
-> Does not merge scans
-> Time stamps and targets must align for meaningful comparison

⦁	Large XML Files
-> Large scans may:
        -> Freeze GUI
        -> Consume high memory
-> Zenmap is not optimized for very large datasets

==========================================================================

5. Alternative Syntax & Additional Options Service

Syntax:
zenmap [alternative syntax options] [result files or service syntax]

Options:
where ever see | means they cannot be combined.

⦁	Long Form Flag Equivalents
--help (equivalent to -h)
--file=<RESULT_FILES> (equivalent to -f)
--nmap (equivalent to -n)
--profile=<PROFILE> (equivalent to -p)
--target=<TARGET> (equivalent to -t)
--verbose (equivalent to -v)

-> All flags have both short (-flag) and long (--flag) form alternatives
-> Long forms are equivalent to short forms shown in Services 1-4
-> --verbose can be used multiple times (like -v) for increased verbosity

⦁	Additional Notes on Flag Usage
-> --file/-f: Can be used multiple times to specify several result files (Service 4)
-> --nmap/-n: Requires quoted nmap arguments as a single string (Service 2)
-> --profile/-p and --target/-t: When combined, automatically runs profile against target (Service 3)
-> --target/-t: If specified alone, opens GUI with target field pre-filled (Service 3)
-> --confdir: Default is /root/.zenmap (or user's home directory equivalent)

⦁	Flag Combinations Across Services
-> --confdir and --verbose/-v can be used with any service (1-4)
-> --version and --help are informational and exit after display
-> Result files (-f/--file) must be in Nmap XML output format
-> Nmap arguments (-n/--nmap) are passed as-is to underlying nmap executable

⦁	Usage Patterns
-> Services 1-4 cover all functional modes of Zenmap
-> Long forms provide more explicit, readable command syntax
-> Short forms provide concise, quick command entry
-> Both forms are functionally identical

=> Alternative syntax options can be used in place of short forms in Services 1-4
=> All long forms are equivalent to their short form counterparts

⦁	--version and --help
-> Always exit immediately
-> Ignore all other flags if combined

⦁	--verbose / -v
-> Affects: Zenmap internal logging
-> Does not increase Nmap verbosity unless: -v is passed inside -n "<nmap args>"

⦁	--nmap vs GUI Profiles
-> When --nmap is used: Profile selection is bypassed
-> When -p/-t is used: Arguments come from profile
-> Mixing mental models leads to confusion
