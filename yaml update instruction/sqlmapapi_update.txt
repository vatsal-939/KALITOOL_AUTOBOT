Sqlmapapi Services:

GLOBAL SQLMAPAPI NOTES (Apply to ALL SERVICES)
⦁	sqlmapapi is a Controller, not a Scanner
=> sqlmapapi does not scan by itself
=> It only:
        => Starts a REST API
        => Submits jobs to sqlmap
        => Manages task lifecycle
=> Automation must clearly separate:
        => API management
        => sqlmap execution logic

⦁	sqlmapapi depends on sqlmap binary
=> If sqlmap is missing / broken:
        => API starts
        => Tasks fail silently
=> Automation should:
        => Validate sqlmap availability before starting server

1.	API Server Service

Syntax:
sqlmapapi --server [server options]

Options:
where ever see | means they cannot be combined.

⦁	Server Network Binding
-H <host>
-p <port>

⦁	Server Backend / Runtime
--adapter=<adapter>

⦁	State Persistence
--database=<filepath>

⦁	Authentication
--username=<username>
--password=<password>

-> Both must be together.

⦁	Binding & Exposure Risk
-> Default binding: 127.0.0.1:8775
-> If user binds: 0.0.0.0
-> Then:
        -> API becomes remotely accessible
        -> Anyone can submit SQLi tasks
-> Strong recommendation: Never expose publicly without authentication

⦁	Authentication Is Weak (Basic Auth Only)
-> Uses HTTP Basic Authentication
-> No:
        -> Token rotation
        -> Rate limiting
        -> Role separation
-> Should only be used:
        -> On localhost
        -> Or behind a reverse proxy

⦁	--username & --password
-> You correctly stated they must be together
-> Additional reality: Credentials are transmitted base64, not encrypted
-> Automation should warn: Use HTTPS or localhost only

⦁	--adapter
-> Uses Python Bottle adapters
-> Common issues:
        -> wsgiref → single-threaded, slow
        -> Other adapters may not be installed
-> Automation should:
        -> Validate adapter availability
        -> Warn about concurrency limitations

⦁	--database
-> Stores:
        -> Task metadata
        -> Session references
-> Important: Not the same as sqlmap session directory
-> If omitted: All task data is lost on restart

==========================================================================

2. API Client Service

Syntax:
sqlmapapi --client [client options]

Options:
where ever see | means they cannot be combined.

⦁	Server Network Binding
-H <host>
-p <port>

⦁	Authentication
--username=<username>
--password=<password>

-> Both must be together.

⦁	Client Mode Does NOT Run Scans
-> sqlmapapi --client:
        -> Only sends HTTP requests
        -> Requires an already running server
-> Automation must: Check server availability before client execution

⦁	Authentication Dependency
-> If server has auth enabled: Client must provide credentials
-> If mismatched:
        -> API responds with 401
        -> No clear error from CLI

⦁	No Task Validation
-> Client does not validate:
        -> sqlmap options
        -> Service compatibility
-> Bad payloads are accepted and fail later
-> Your service-based validation layer is necessary

==========================================================================

3. Informational & Alternative Syntax Service

Syntax:
sqlmapapi [informational/alternative syntax options]

Options:
where ever see | means they cannot be combined.

⦁	Help & Documentation
-h | --help

-> Show help message and exit

⦁	Short Form Flag Equivalents
-s (equivalent to --server)
-c (equivalent to --client)

-> -s/--server: Run as REST-JSON API server (used in Service 1 syntax)
-> -c/--client: Run as REST-JSON API client (used in Service 2 syntax)
-> Both short and long forms are equivalent and interchangeable

⦁	Default Values Note
-> -H/--host defaults to "127.0.0.1" if not specified
-> -p/--port defaults to 8775 if not specified
-> --adapter defaults to "wsgiref" if not specified (for server mode)

⦁	Additional Notes
-> Service 1 and Service 2 cover all functional options from help output
-> Short forms (-s, -c) can be used instead of long forms (--server, --client)
-> Authentication options (--username, --password) are optional but must be used together if authentication is needed
-> Database option (--database) is optional and used for IPC state persistence in server mode

=> Informational option (-h/--help) is standalone (exits after showing help)
=> Short form flags are alternative syntax for Service 1 and Service 2 modes

⦁	-h / --help
-> Shows only API-level help
-> Does NOT show:
        -> sqlmap scan options
        -> Task parameters
-> Automation must expose both layers separately:
        -> sqlmapapi options
        -> sqlmap options

⦁	Short Flags (-s, -c)
-> Correctly mapped
-> Additional note:
        -> Using both together (-s -c) is invalid
        -> Only one mode allowed per run
